For many Marxists, technology is at worst neutral: it is not the technology itself, but who controls it, labor or capital.

But this project is not simply a philosophical endeavor. Rather, Marxist theory has to be put to the test of history, the test of the actual practices of workers themselves—those actions that inspired Marx’s theorizations and the work of many of the best Marxists after him. And so I also recover important struggles where workers focused not only on their class antagonist (personified by bosses or managers), but on the machines deployed in this struggle as well.

And yet, our billionaires and their Ivy League hangers-on protest too much. Their blithe boosterism for optimism itself belies the fact that among those of less-than-astronomical means, technological optimism is on the wane. We are increasingly turning against the technologies that saturate our work and leisure, and I think there are powerful political possibilities here, but only if this perspective is connected to a larger critique of the social and economic system in which we live: capitalism. Marxist theory offers many important tools in understanding how capitalism works, and how it can be changed—tools I want to share with people who may not think of themselves as Marxists.

Its gambit was that we could take a cybernetic leap out of late neoliberalism’s doldrums. But the tenor has changed. After 2016, fewer people than ever have faith in the future, and still fewer believe in the salutary effects of the latest developments in digital networks, automation, or artificial intelligence. “Twitter revolutions” in the Middle East have been ground into dust. The cheap scooters of the so-called sharing economy choke our streets, and we collectively celebrate their destruction on the Instagram account Bird Graveyard.

In some cases, weavers successfully appealed to prior government decisions protecting their livelihoods from technology. However, after just a few years, the situation was rapidly changing. Parliament’s preoccupation with the wars against Napoleon meant it had little patience for the demands of unruly craftsmen.

His bête noire, going back to his experience as a foreman, was “soldiering,” where workers toiled below their maximum effort. Taylor, with his factory floor experience, understood that workers could control their pace of work because they possessed a distinct advantage over their managers: their knowledge of the production process. At the turn of the century, it was the workers, rather than their overseers, who understood how manufacturing worked, and their methods for completing tasks were often based on intuitive and informal “rules of thumb”: what color a chemical admixture should take, the appropriate heft of a specific part, and the like. Factory owners and managers might have only a dim idea about how products were actually put together, and no ability to do it themselves. This control of knowledge meant that workers could control the pace of work. Out of desire or necessity, they could slow it down, even stop it altogether."}]}

Based on a particular interpretation of Marx’s theory, they believed that capitalism, in its pursuit of profit, raised productivity through competitive technological innovation and the discovery of efficient working methods. These discoveries had no politics of their own; technology was neutral and could be appropriated with a change in ownership from private capital to state control, and thereby used to emancipate workers from drudgery. True, these new forms of work were difficult, dangerous, and widely hated. But if workers could table their protests about the productive forces, they could enjoy a world of plentiful goods and leisure—eventually. In other words, for orthodox Marxist theory, socialist production was already contained within the capitalist mode of production, as long as the capitalist mode of production could continue to develop."}]}

While capitalist economies had gone through a long period of decline, they seemed to emerge, through consolidation into monopolies and trusts, into a new phase of stability. As socialists scrambled to make sense of the new situation, two leading perspectives emerged. One pole, represented by Kautsky and the young Polish-German communist Rosa Luxemburg, thought that the increased concentration of capital was the last step before a crisis and a revolutionary situation. On the other, Erfurt Program coauthor Eduard Bernstein argued that this indicated, rather, an unfore-told resilience of capitalism, which meant that revolution was off the table. Luxemburg’s 1899 polemic against Bernstein’s “revisionism,” Social Reform or Revolution, takes up this very question. In it, she argues that the contradictions of capitalism had not been overcome, but had been intensified, even as the final crisis was temporarily postponed. In doing so, Luxemburg reveals her continued debt to Kautskyian determinism: she counters Bernstein’s “ethical socialism” with the “objective necessity of socialism, the explanation of socialism as the result of the material development of society”—in other words, a socialism proceeding mechanically from a terminal crisis stemming from internal contradictions of capitalist"}]}

While automation’s defenders, such as Macleod, pointed to the gains in “efficiency” brought by the new methods, David Noble’s historical research on the process tells a different story.

These groups viewed their task as the analysis of actually existing class struggles at the point of production.

Two decades later, Martin Luther King Jr. and Bayard Rustin organized the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. As the integration of the workplace was a major goal, postwar civil rights leaders viewed automation, and its disruptive impact on labor markets, as a potential problem for their movements. In a 1961 address to the AFL-CIO, Martin Luther King Jr. declared, “Labor today faces a grave crisis. In the next ten to twenty years automation will grind jobs into dust as it grinds out unbelievable volumes of production.” King understood that automation was a weapon to be used against organized labor: “This period is made to order for those who would seek to drive labor into impotency by viciously attacking it at every point of weakness.” And the unions’ only chance to take control of the course of automation was to forge a common cause with the civil rights movement: “The political strength you are going to need to"}]}

The dark web runs on the Tor protocol, which obfuscates user activity by routing it through an anonymous distributed architecture. By shielding user activity from the gaze of tracking technologies, Tor prevents this activity from being vacuumed up as data, and thus decommodifies it. Of course, the dark web is not itself free of commodification: in fact, the purchase and sale of goods and services, often of the illegal variety, runs rampant. Thus the dark web is not a space without market exchange, but a space without surveillance capitalism.

Whole segments of the economy are being shifted from older unprofitable industries (i.g. auto, steel) to the dazzling information sector. This necessarily changes the details of our daily lives. Robots, word processors and communication networks are only a few of the new machines that are part of the modern information-based society."}]}

Remote terminals, they argue, will allow people to do their work in their own homes at their own speeds. While this vision has serious flaws in itself, it is unlikely that management will relinquish control over the work process. In fact, rather than freeing clerks from the gaze of their supervisors, the management statistics programs that many new systems provide will allow the careful scrutiny of each worker's output regardless of where the work is done. Decentralization, assuming it happens at all, will more likely bring about the reintroduction of piece work, while breaking down the type of work cultures discussed above that contribute to the low productivity of office workers."}]}

The individual \"freedoms'' that are created by the technological wonders of tele-shopping and home banking are illusory. At most they are conveniences that allow for the more efficient ordering of modern life. The basis of social life is not touched by the \"revolution.'' As in the office it remains hierarchical. In fact, the power of those in control is enhanced because there is an illusion of increased freedom.

When computers were first introduced for such things as billings and phone lists, people's immediate response was one of resentment at what they perceived as a loss in power. Who hasn't had the experience of battling an \"infallible'' computer that kept charging you for the same shirt, lost all your college records or disconnected your phone call for the fourth time? The point here is not that computers don't work but that this new technology provides authorities with a shield for their power. The frustration and powerlessness that people feel can conveniently be blamed on computer error."}]}

Everyone has probably heard a version of the story about the irate housewife storming into the nearest PG&E office to do summary justice to a guilty computer with a shotgun. Incidents of sabotage that contain a \"social critique'' have also taken place. In 1970 an anti-war group calling itself BEAVER 55 \"invaded'' a Hewlett Packard installation in Minnesota and did extensive damage to hardware, tapes and data. More recently (April, 1980), a group in France (CLODO--The Committee to Liquidate or Divert Computers) raided a computer software firm in Toulouse, destorying programs, tapes and punch cards."}]}

The French group, which had many computer workers as members, went further, condemning computers for warping cultural priorities as well as for being the preferred tools of the police and other repressive institutions. The implications of the repressive and socially negative ways in which computers are used need to be explored. However, in their emphasis on massive destruction, groups such as the above direct themselves too much against the technology itself (not to mention those groups' authoritarian internal structure). They do not pursue the positive aim of subverting computers, of exploring the relationship between a given technology and the use to which it is put. In this sense, pranks and theft, often carried out spontaneously and almost always individually, are more radical than the actions of those who group themselves around a specific political ideology."}]}

The technology that has been developed to maintain profits and existing institutions of social control is extremely vulnerable to sabotage and subversion, especially in this transition period. If we are to avoid an alienated electronic version of capitalism, in which control is subtle but absolute, we will need to extend the subversion of machines and work process to an all out attack on the social relations that make them possible."}]}
